# Scrubbie
C# Scrubbing
Simple helper class for doing text scrubbing. 

Strip stings from other strings
Replace by list of regexs
Replace words by other words
Translate characters from one set to another

Todo: 
This is a .Net 2.0 Core build. Need to make it a package for nuget.org
More useful functionality, still basically a wrapper around regex stuff
Add constant regex patterns for things like space removal, trim, etc
